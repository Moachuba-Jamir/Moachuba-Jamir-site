Creating a new branch
    git branch -c addSpinner

moving to any other brach 
    git checkout addSpinner

create and edit necessary changes 
then do .... git add . (adding all the unchecked files) // this adds it to the brach 


now we commit

git commit -m "added spinner"

// now it's commited to the branch (it's not going nowhere)

now we push it to the head of the origin 

git push origin head 

to merge with the main or master branch 

go to main 
    git checkout main 
    git merge addedSpinner
    
    for now go the github site and compare and pull 
    next we merge
